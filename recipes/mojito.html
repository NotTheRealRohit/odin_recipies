    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Mojito is a traditional Cuban highball. The cocktail often consists of five ingredients: white rum, sugar (traditionally sugar cane juice), 
        lime juice, soda water, and mint.[1][2] Its combination of sweetness, citrus, and herbaceous mint flavors is intended to complement the rum, 
        and has made the mojito a popular summer drink
